### What is Evolve ?

Evolve is a database migration tool for .NET and .NET Core, inspired by [Flyway](https://flywaydb.org/).

Its purpose is to automate your database changes, and help keep those changes synchronized through all your environments and development teams.
This makes it an ideal tool for continuous integration / delivery.

Over all Evolve embraces simplicity. It uses straight SQL scripts and every time you build your project, it will automatically ensure your database is up-to-date, without having to do anything other than build.

Install it and forget it!
